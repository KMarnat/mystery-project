          You need to be present at Dreamhack and show up at the Lenovo Legion and Intel booth the
          day you have won and within opening hours in order to claim your prize. If you are unable
          to show up, then we can unfortunately not grant you your otherwise well deserved prize. We
          will instead draw a new winner for which the same procedure as above applies. Once your

          during Dreamhack, however you can only win once.
